    ## DAG Diagnostics
    
    This DAG provides comprehensive diagnostics for MWAA environments including:
    - Airflow configuration change detection and conflict analysis
    - DAG serialization analysis
    - Performance monitoring
    - Failure pattern analysis
    - Serialization instability detection
    - Traffic pattern and concurrency analysis
    - System metrics collection
    
    ### Parameters:
    - **analysis_days**: Number of days to analyze (default: 7)
    - **env_name**: Environment name for reports (default: from Variable)
    - **s3_bucket**: S3 bucket for saving reports (default: from Variable)
    
    ### Usage:
    Trigger with custom parameters:
    ```json
    {
        "analysis_days": 14,
        "env_name": "MyEnvironment",
        "s3_bucket": "my-diagnostics-bucket"
    }
